The first notebook is a classification model, predicting claimant vs non-claimant.

A variety of missing value imputation methods are used, and nested cross validation is used to find the optimal combination of imputation method, algorithm and associated parameters.

The second notebook is a regression model, predicting the size of the claimants.
